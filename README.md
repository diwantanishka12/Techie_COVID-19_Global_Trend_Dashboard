# _**Objective of the Project:**_
This project aims to analyze global vaccination data to derive insights such as total vaccinations, country-wise vaccination trends, and other relevant metrics.

# _**Tools and Libraries Used:**_
Python: Programming language for data analysis and visualization.

Pandas: For data manipulation and preprocessing.

Matplotlib: For creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations.

Seaborn: For statistical data visualization.

Ipywidgets: For creating interactive widgets in Jupyter notebooks.

# _**Data Source(s):**_
The dataset used for analysis is "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gpreda/covid-world-vaccination-progress", which includes country-wise vaccination data.

# _**Execution Steps:**_
1. Install the required Python libraries:

   "pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn ipywidgets"

3. Load the dataset and perform data preprocessing, including handling missing values and converting columns to appropriate formats.

4. Run the analysis scripts to generate insights and visualizations.

5. Save the processed data for further use.

# _**Summary of Results:**_
Total vaccinations globally were calculated.

Country-wise vaccination trends and maximum vaccinations were analyzed.

Cleaned data was saved for future applications.


# _**Challenges Faced:**_
Handling missing data effectively to avoid skewed results.

Ensuring the datetime format was consistent across the dataset.
