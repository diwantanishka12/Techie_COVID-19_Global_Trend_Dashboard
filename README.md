# _**Objective of the Project:**_
This project aims to analyze global vaccination data to derive insights such as total vaccinations, country-wise vaccination trends, and other relevant metrics.

# _**Tools and Libraries Used:**_
Python: Programming language for data analysis and visualization.

Pandas: For data manipulation and preprocessing.

Matplotlib: For creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations.

Seaborn: For statistical data visualization.

Ipywidgets: For creating interactive widgets in Jupyter notebooks.

# _**Data Source(s):**_
The dataset used for analysis is "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gpreda/covid-world-vaccination-progress", which includes country-wise vaccination data.

# _**Execution Steps:**_
1. Install the required Python libraries.

2. Load the Dataset:
   Import the dataset ("/content/country_vaccinations.csv") into your Python environment using pandas.

4. Data Preprocessing:
   Convert date columns to datetime format.

5. Run Analysis Scripts:
   Calculate global and country-wise vaccination statistics.

   Generate summary statistics or insights.

   Create visualizations using matplotlib and seaborn to illustrate trends.

6. Save Processed Data:
   Export the cleaned dataset for further use

7. View Results:
   Interpret the generated output (visualizations, summaries) to derive insights from the vaccination data.
# _**Summary of Results:**_
Total vaccinations globally were calculated.

Country-wise vaccination trends and maximum vaccinations were analyzed.

Cleaned data was saved for future applications.


# _**Challenges Faced:**_
Handling missing data effectively to avoid skewed results.

Ensuring the datetime format was consistent across the dataset.
